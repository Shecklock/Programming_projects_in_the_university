<h1>Programming_summary</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is all the programming project I have done in the first year of my Cybersecurity degree, we start in Processing and changed to Eclpise for Java.
The learning object/timeline are as below:

26-Sep-2022 to 31-oct-2022: Leaning to program, getting hands on the workstation(Processing: https://processing.org/) leaning the very very basic such as Iterations, methods and classes and objects.

Objective and corresponeding files name:

Learning to program: sketch_220928a.pde 
Making decisions in code: sketch_221003c.pde 
Iteration:  sketch_221013h.pde 
Methods:  sketch_221017d.pde p
Classes and objects: porfolio_5.pde
Using arrays: RaceTrack.pde

14-NOV-2022 to 12-DEC-2022: Leanign more in program concept such as Strings and ArrayLists, hashMaps.

Objective and corresponeding files name:

Strings and ArrayLists: Button.pde
HashMaps and INteracting with the user: SETUP.zip
Searching/sorting and a bit of design: 9.2.zip
Java without processing(note, this starts to swithcing to Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ for java, getting more into the java language): Lab10.zip

23-Jan-2023 to 24-Apr-2023: More concept for Java, like TDD, abstract classes and interfaces, UML, design patterns, etc.

Objective and corresponding files name:

Test-driven develiopment(TDD): submission-lab01-tdd.zip
Organisng Java programs and inheritance I: submission-lab02-inheritance.zip
Inheritance II, abstract classes and interfaces: submission-lab03-acint.zip
Inheritance III, responsibility-driven design: submission-lab04-rdd.zip
Unified modelling Language(UML): submission-lab05-uml.zip
Design patterns: submission-lab06-dpatterns.zip
Java collections Framework: submission-lab07-jcf.zip
Building graphical user interfaces with JavaFX: submission.zip
Exceptions: submission-lab09-javafx-assessed.zip
File I/O and test design: submission-lab10-recipes.zip

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I have learnt a lot through this module, and gained a lot of experiences. I tried to give up a few(so some of them can be improve more to be honest, some of them may not working also).
